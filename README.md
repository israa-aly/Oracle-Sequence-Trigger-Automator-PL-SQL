## Script Description:
This PL/SQL script automates the process of recreating sequences and triggers for primary keys in Oracle tables.
It performs the following actions for each table with a single-column primary key of data type NUMBER:
- Drops existing sequences associated with the table.
- Determines the maximum ID for the primary key column.
- Creates a new sequence for the table, starting from the maximum ID value.
- Creates or replaces a trigger for the table to automatically assign values from the sequence to the primary key column upon insertion.
## Instructions for Use:
# Prerequisites:
- Ensure that the user executing this script has the necessary privileges to create sequences and triggers and to execute dynamic SQL (DDL).
- This script assumes that the primary keys are single-column and of data type NUMBER.
## Setup:
Copy the script into a PL/SQL editor or directly execute it in an Oracle SQL client.
## Execution:
Run the script in the desired environment where it needs to be executed.
## Output:
- The script will create or replace sequences and triggers for each eligible table in the user's schema.
- Any errors encountered during execution will be displayed.
## Important Notes:
- Backup: Before executing this script in a production environment, ensure that you have a backup of the database schema.
- Testing: Always test the script in a development or test environment before applying it to production.
- Validation: Validate the functionality of sequences and triggers after script execution to ensure data integrity.
